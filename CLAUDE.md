---

## Key Design Decisions

- **`execute_wrapper`** (not signals or middleware) — lower overhead, works in tests without HTTP.
- **Frozen dataclass** for `ORMRecommendation` — hashable, sortable, immutable.
- **`StrEnum` Severity** — allows `rec.severity == "high"` comparisons without importing the enum.
- **Threshold constants at module level** (`SLOW_QUERY_THRESHOLD_MS`, `DUPLICATE_MIN_COUNT`) — easy to override in tests.
- **pytest plugin registered via `entry-points`** — zero-config activation after `pip install`.

---

## Commands

```bash
make docker-test    # full test suite + coverage (CI target)
make docker-lint    # ruff check + mypy
make lint-all       # lint + typecheck (alias)
make pre-commit     # run all pre-commit hooks on every file
make install-dev    # local dev install (not for test execution)
```

> **Never run pytest / ruff / mypy directly on the host.** Always use `make` targets.

Coverage threshold: **85%** (enforced by `pytest-cov` with `fail_under = 85`).

---

## Adding a New Detector

1. Create `src/django_query_optimizer/detectors/<name>.py` implementing `detect(queries) -> list[ORMRecommendation]`.
2. Export the class from `__init__.py` and add it to `__all__`.
3. Write a matching test class in `tests/unit/test_<name>_detector.py`.
4. Update the detector table in `README.md` and this file.
5. Use an existing `Severity` level or add to the enum if justified.

---

## Conventions

- Public API exports live in `__init__.py.__all__` — nothing else is considered stable.
- No breaking changes without a major version bump.
- All type annotations must pass `mypy --strict`.
- Commit identity: `user.name=chrysa`, `user.email=greau.anthony+chrysa@gmail.com`.

## Non-negotiable conventions

- **Language**: English — all code, comments, docs, instructions, and config files.
- **Commits**: Conventional Commits (`feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `ci`).
- **Branches**: `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `chore/`, `hotfix/`, `release/` · default branch `develop`.
- **Merge**: squash merge only · force push forbidden · auto-merge requires CI + owner.
- **One PR per issue**, scoped tight. Every PR references an issue (`Closes/Fixes/Refs #N`).
  Exception: label `hotfix`. The `enforce-issue-link` workflow is a blocking status check.
- **Tests: pytest only** — assert-style test functions and `pytest-mock` (`mocker`
  fixture: `mocker.patch`, `mocker.AsyncMock`) for all mocking. The stdlib **`unittest`
  framework (`unittest.TestCase`) and `unittest.mock` imports are forbidden** — no
  `import unittest`, no `from unittest.mock import …`. See the `testing-pytest` skill.
- **Dark mode** mandatory from V1. **Accessibility** WCAG 2.1 AA.
- **UI state survives reload & focus** — human-facing surfaces persist their navigation
  and view state (active tab/section, selected sub-view, active context/filters) so a
  **manual reload keeps the current page** — the user lands exactly where they were, never
  reset to a default. Persist to `localStorage` (or the URL for shareable state), guarded
  by a validator that discards stale/removed values. Interface or state changes must
  **propagate across the app's own tabs/windows and on refocus/reload**: listen to the
  browser `storage` event and re-read on `window` `focus`, so a view opened while hidden
  never shows stale state after the user comes back. A reload that loses the user's place,
  or a change that fails to propagate on focus/reload, is a bug.
- **Notion logging**: every advancement and modification (progress, decisions, state
  changes) is logged in Notion — the single source of truth. Run `@notion-sync` after any
  state change; in case of conflict between local docs and Notion, Notion wins.
- **No hardcoded constants** in code — neither backend (Python) nor frontend (TS).
  All constants and config values (thresholds, business rules, labels, URLs, magic
  numbers) live in **external YAML files** and are loaded at runtime. Code reads them
  through a typed loader (Pydantic Settings backend · generated typed module frontend),
  never as inline literals. Only language-level enums (e.g. `status.HTTP_*`) are exempt.
- **Semantic URLs & code** — URLs are resource-oriented and human-readable: lowercase,
  hyphenated, plural-noun collections, no verbs or actions in the path (`GET /invoices/42`,
  never `/getInvoice?id=42`); REST shapes follow the `api-design` skill. Code is
  self-describing: intention-revealing names over comments, semantic HTML elements
  (`<nav>`, `<button>`, `<main>`, `<header>`…) never a `<div>` wired as a control, and
  ARIA used only to fill gaps native semantics cannot express.

## Quality gates

- Test coverage **>= 85%** by default. A repo may override upward, never below 80%.
- Lint warnings: **0**. Mypy clean. SonarCloud rating **A**, 0 security hotspot.
- Max function lines 50 · max file lines 500 · cyclomatic complexity heuristic <= 10.

## Shared UI library contract (`@chrysa/ui`)

The shared component library is the single source of UX truth; a defect there
propagates to every consumer. The library **guarantees**, it does not suggest
(see ADR-0005):

- **Ships its own styles.** The package delivers its CSS + design tokens (dark +
  light), not just class names. A consumer importing `@chrysa/ui` with zero extra
  CSS renders WCAG 2.1 AA, `:focus-visible`, ≥44px targets, and honours
  `prefers-reduced-motion`. Kill-test: a bare consumer passes an axe-core AA scan
  with no local style overrides.
- **Owns the non-nominal states.** Every data component exposes `loading` / `empty`
  / `error`; the app never reinvents them. `BackendConnectionBanner` is provided
  **and mounted** by the shell — never shipped as dead code.
- **A11y is mandatory by type, not by discipline.** `Input` requires a label or
  `aria-label` and wires `aria-invalid`/`aria-describedby`; overlays trap focus and
  close on `Esc`; `Icon` requires `aria-label` or `aria-hidden`. A prop that lets
  a11y be omitted is a bug.

## CLI UX (every distributed command-line surface)

A CLI is a human-facing surface, held to the same "no surprises" bar as the web UI
(see ADR-0005; enforced via the `cli-developer` agent brief):

- `--version` and `--help` (with examples) on every command and sub-command.
- **stdout = data, stderr = logs/errors.** Machine output via `--json` on stdout only.
- Documented, stable **exit codes** (`0` ok · `1` findings/soft-fail · `2` usage).
- Colour only on a TTY; honour `NO_COLOR`; never ANSI in a pipe.
- Any destructive command offers a **truly non-destructive `--dry-run`** (writes
  nothing — verified by a test) and a non-interactive flag for CI.
- Error messages are actionable: what failed **and** how to fix it.

A CLI missing `--version`, or whose `--dry-run` writes, is a bug.

## Makefile targets

- **Referential**: `Forge-Stack-Workshop/base-makefile` (`Makefile.basic`, `Makefile.python`,
  `Makefile.with-sub-folder`) is the single source of truth for target names and behaviour.
- **Canonical naming** — follow base-makefile verbatim, one word where it is one word:
  `typecheck` (**never** `type-check`), `test-cov`, `format-check`, `quality-gate-verify`,
  `docker-test`, `ci`. Renaming or aliasing a canonical target is forbidden.
- **Mandatory socle** — every application repo MUST expose, with these exact names and intent:
  `help install install-dev lint format format-check typecheck test test-cov pre-commit clean
  ci quality-gate-baseline quality-gate-verify`. Non-applicative repos (pure infra/Helm/Terraform,
  config-only, docs) are exempt from the language-specific targets (`typecheck`, `test-cov`) but
  still expose `help lint pre-commit clean`.
- **Docs must match** — every `make <target>` cited in `CLAUDE.md` or `README.md` MUST exist in
  the Makefile (no `make type-check` when the target is `typecheck`).
- **Recipe style** — prefix every recipe line with `@`; add `## Description` after each target so
  it appears in `make help`.

## Error handling pattern (all automations)

```text
try:    fn()
except: gh issue create --title "[chrysa] failure" --label "chrysa-error"
```

## Observability — Sentry → GitHub issues (norm)

Every status:dev repo ships a Sentry project, and **a new Sentry issue automatically opens a
GitHub issue** via Sentry's native GitHub integration. No relay, no PAT in the repo — the
integration owns the link, so a Sentry issue maps to exactly one GitHub issue (no duplicates).

Mechanism: a per-project Sentry **issue alert rule** with
condition `FirstSeenEventCondition` (a new issue is created) and action
`GitHubCreateTicketAction` targeting `chrysa/<repo>`, labels `sentry`, `bug`.
Provision it across all projects with
`shared-standards/scripts/sentry-github-issues.sh` (idempotent, `--dry-run` first).

Per-project activation checklist:

1. Org GitHub integration installed once in Sentry (Settings → Integrations → GitHub) with
   access to the chrysa repos.
2. The repo has a Sentry project whose slug matches the repo name.
3. The auto-issue alert rule exists (run the provisioning script, or add it in
   Alerts → Create Alert → Issues → action "Create a GitHub issue").
4. The GitHub repo has a `sentry` label (CI label sync provides it).

## Governance — strategic pillars & ADR format

Five non-negotiables hold across every chrysa project, whatever the stack. Breaking one
requires an ADR with a kill-test, not a shrug.

1. **LLM-provider independence** — no vendor SDK in business code; inference goes through a
   local port with **≥2 real, tested adapters** (e.g. Claude + a local model). A prompt that
   only works on one vendor is a bug, not a feature.
2. **GAFAM independence** — every managed-cloud dependency has a documented self-hosted exit
   path; the cloud SDK stays confined to an adapter (`BlobStore`, not `S3Client`).
3. **Portable personalisation data** — all user/personal data is exportable to an open format
   (JSON/SQLite) by a documented command; `export → import → export` is idempotent (tested).
   A stored-but-unexportable field needs an ADR.
4. **k8s config in-project** — manifests live in `deploy/k8s/` of the repo; nothing exists
   only inside a running cluster.
5. **Adaptation layer** — no third-party lib/API/service is imported by the domain directly;
   it goes through an adapter whose port is written in the domain's language, not the vendor's.

**ADR format (refutable).** Any structural decision — new external dependency, LLM/cloud
provider choice, breaking public-API change, data-model change, or a pillar exception — gets
one ADR under `docs/adr/` (series named in the local `CLAUDE.md`). Beyond the classic fields,
every chrysa ADR carries three that make it falsifiable:

- **Fatal hypothesis** — the single, falsifiable belief whose falsity invalidates the decision.
  One only; about the real world (cost, latency, a third party), not an internal intention.
- **Kill-test** — the observable, dated signal that proves it wrong: what to measure, which
  threshold, when checked, what happens on breach. Mechanised as a test where possible.
- **Validation gate** — the pre-agreed condition that unlocks the next step, written *before*
  building.

`Killed` is a valid ADR status: the kill-test fired and the hypothesis was false. A corpus with
no `Killed` entry has kill-tests that are too lax. Scaffold a new record with `/adr-new`.
